Run backend tests and verify server health:

1. Check if backend directory exists with required files (app.py, spotify.py, requirements.txt)
2. Verify .env file is configured with Spotify credentials
3. If backend server is running on port 8000, test the /api/token endpoint
4. If not running, provide instructions to start it
5. Report any issues found
